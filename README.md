This application is a personal project intended to mirror an iPhone contact application.  The purpose is to provide functionality that allows a user to do a few things: view a list of saved contacts, dynamically render contact information, search for specific contacts via speific wording or lettering, sort the list in either ascending or descending order, and finally, add a contact to the overall list.
